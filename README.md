# Slides_with_beamer

Introduction to the beamer LaTeX class - basically coding to produce slides and presentations

### Mario Cortina Borja, ICH Code Club, 26th February 2020

Beamer is a LaTeX document class for creating presentation slides, with a wide range of templates and a set of features for making slideshow effects.  Itsname is taken from the German word "Beamer" as a pseudo-anglicism for "video projector". 

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX) for definitions and a bit of history.  

For this session of the UCL ICH Code club you have to install MikTeX version 2.9 in your computer; download it (installer is 233MB) from 
https://miktex.org/download Once downloaded, run basic-miktex-2.9.7351-x64.exe (or similar name) from your download directory. Accept conditions and set installation scope (e.g. only for you, or if you're an aministrator, you have the option to set up MiKTeX for all users). In my installation, its location is

c:\Users\userUCL\AppData\Local\Programs\MixTeX\2.9

where userUCL is my UCL username.

If asked, set preferred paper as A4, and Ask me first to the question Install missing packages on-the-fly? 

Start installation; check for updates now; Close the wizard.

You may be notified of updates, for example to mixtex-misc and to ltxbase; click update now. tThis install package updates.

Once this is installed, I recommend you download sumatraPDF3.1.2, a pdf reader that works well with TeXworks, the editor installed by MiKTeX:

https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/download-free-pdf-viewer.html

Run SumatraPDF-3.1.2-64-install.exe (or something similar) from your downloads directory.

Sumatra is available for Windows OS, I don't know what pdf viewer you may use.  TeXworks allows comping TeX code and creating pdf's, I'm sure it'll find a pdf reader in your Mac.

Run TeXworks from your start window (or equivalent in Mac).  


Save the files First_beamer.tex, First_beamer_UCL.tex and First_beamer_UCL.tex from this repository in a directory, e.g. beamerFiles\ and open them with TeXworks.  The first time you run beamer it'll ask you whether you want to install programmes etc.  The default option <Random package repository> should be OK. There may be a few packages and style files to be installed.  Each package has its own directory in c:\Users\userUCL\AppData\Local\Programs\MixTeX2.9\
  
Go to https://github.com/UCL/ucl-beamer and copy the directory banners to your \beamerfiles directory
  
To compile your code, click the green arrow on the top left of the editor. Compilation might generate some strange messages... and if successful, you'll see your pdf in sumatra.

Please bring your laptop with MikTeX installed. The meeting will take place on Wed 26th Feb in Room C of the Wolfson Centre, 12:30-1:30pm.
